This project has 3 parts:

1. Familiarize yourself with the problem and data
2. Code a KNN Classifier from scratch, evaluate performance, and compare to Scikit-Learn's implementation
3. Interpret results and explain findings.

This will include:
1. Answering simple questions regarding the data
2. Manipulating multiple DataFrames
3. Coding functions to:
     1. Calculate Euclidean distance
     2. Calculate distance between many pairs of points
     3. Implement a majority voting system
  
  -Combine the above to create a custom KNN algorithm
  -Use KNeighborsClassifier in sklearn
